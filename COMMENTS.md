It has been a fun and exciting exercise. I enjoyed creating this design and playing with the charts. Also, I have learnt a lot about DMARC protocol, something that I didn't know before.

One of the first things I did was to update the frontend dependencies to use the most recent ones (or at least the most recent one compatibles with the software version) and the webpack configuration.

I noticed that the React template provided was using Class components. I updated it in order to use React Hooks, which personally, I think it makes the code clearer.
Additionally, I have also discard PropTypes in favour of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Apart from the advantages that it offers, it is very integrated with most of the modern Text editors like VSCode.

Unfortunately, I was running short on time and I didn't want to delay the delivery of the test another day. Because of this, there are a couple of tasks that I would like to have finished but didn't have enough time for.
Please, let me know if you would like me to do the points under the Improvements section.

## Improvements

- Mobile version: As I mentioned above, because I was getting short on time, I couldn't optimise the mobile version. If this is necessary, please let me know and I will update it immediately. As this design is a grid layout, it wouldn't take long to adapt it to smaller screens. I normally build the layouts following the mobile-first methodology but I wasn't sure if this type of dashboard is meant to be used on mobile. In order to save time, I went for the desktop version first.

- Unit tests and integration tests: I didn't have the time to write them. Again, if you would like to see some test, please, let me know.

## Challenges

Perhaps the biggest challenge for this test was updating the old versions. For a while, I had issues loading images or typescripts problem related to older package versions but I managed to get everything working well at the end.
Understanding the data flow and how the SDK took its fair enough of time too.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm very happy with the final result. I think I have met the goal of the test and I really like the "look and feel" of the final result. This project allowed me to learn new things and overcoming the challenges made me a better developer.

Please, let me know if you have any question.

Thank you,
